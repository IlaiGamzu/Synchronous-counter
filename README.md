# Synchronous-counter
Hello everyone!

It's my pleasure that you see my project.

- I built a Synchronous-counter from 74HC08 and 74HC76.
- You can see the result in the lab environment and also in the Multisim program (Has a video clip that shows how the counter works).
- In addition the Synchronous-counter will count from zero to four in binary, meaning from 000 to 100 (modulo 5), when 1- means the Led is light and 0- the Led is off.
- For example- 001 (in Decimal is 1) means that the left and middle led is off and the right led is on.
Use in Led bar to expose the numbers and Comb resistors (400 Ohm).
Enjoy!
